              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                History, discipline that studies the chronological record of
                events, usually attempting, on the basis of a critical
                examination of source materials, to explain events. For the
                principal treatment of the writing of history, and the scholarly
                research associated with it, see historiography. There are many
                branches of the study of history, among them world history,
                intellectual history, social history, economic history, and art
                history. The term philosophy of history refers to the study of
                how history as a discipline is practiced and how historians
                understand and explain the past.

              <h3>Vision</h3>
              <p>
                Vision is the complex, multipart process that gives you your
                sense of sight. Vision itself doesn’t happen in your eyes.
                Instead, it’s the sum of your eyes, retinas, optic nerves and
                brain working together to process reflected light from the world
                around you. Maintaining your vision can make a big difference in
                your well-being and quality of life.
